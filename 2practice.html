  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <hr>
  <p> <strong>Hyy</strong>.  Today is my first day of learning html.
    I enjoy exploring different kinds of stories, 
    learning new things, and improving my imagination through reading. It helps me relax, 
    gain knowledge, and see the world from different perspectives.
